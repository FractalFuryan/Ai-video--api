ADDITIONAL ETHICAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

These additional terms supplement the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
They apply to all uses of this software.

1. ETHICAL GEOMETRY CLAUSE

   This software may not be modified to generate, represent, or encode:
   
   a) Facial geometry, facial features, or biometric identifiers
   b) Identity markers, portraits, or likenesses of real persons
   c) Photorealistic imagery or pixel-based renderings
   d) Human body proportions or anatomical measurements
   e) Any geometry designed to circumvent ethical constraints
   
   Any such modification constitutes a material violation of these terms and
   immediately terminates all rights granted under this license.

2. ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY REQUIREMENT

   The following core architectural constraints must be preserved:
   
   a) No pixel generation - system must output only geometry tokens
   b) Deterministic parsing - same input must produce same output
   c) Ethics validation - all output must pass structural validation
   d) Sealed containers - all output must maintain H4MK provenance
   e) Client-side rendering - no server-side rasterization permitted
   
   Removal or circumvention of these constraints voids this license.

3. COMMERCIAL USE TERMS

   Commercial use is permitted only if:
   
   a) No modifications violate the Ethical Geometry Clause (Section 1)
   b) All generated content remains structurally auditable
   c) Source code modifications are contributed back under AGPLv3
   d) Commercial users publicly disclose use of this software
   e) The HarmonyØ4 name is used only for unmodified versions
   
   Commercial users must maintain the ethical guarantees or cease use.

4. SEALED PROVENANCE REQUIREMENT

   All outputs generated by this software must:
   
   a) Maintain cryptographic provenance trails (H4MK containers)
   b) Include deterministic UIDs for all geometry tokens
   c) Preserve audit metadata (generation time, parameters, version)
   d) Remain verifiable against source prompts
   
   Removal of audit trails, provenance data, or UID generation is prohibited
   and constitutes a violation of these terms.

5. ETHICAL RESEARCH EXCEPTION

   Modifications for genuine security research are permitted if:
   
   a) Research aims to strengthen ethical constraints
   b) Findings are responsibly disclosed to maintainers
   c) Exploits are not weaponized or commercialized
   d) Results are published openly for community benefit

6. TERMINATION

   Violation of any term in this license immediately terminates all rights
   granted herein. Upon termination, you must:
   
   a) Cease all use, distribution, and modification of the software
   b) Destroy all copies in your possession or control
   c) Notify all downstream recipients of the termination
   
   Automatic reinstatement is not available for ethical violations.

7. ATTRIBUTION AND TRADEMARK

   "HarmonyØ4" and "Ethical Geometry Generator" are identifying marks of
   this project. You may use these names only to:
   
   a) Refer to the unmodified original software
   b) Make factual statements about compatibility
   c) Acknowledge use in derivative works (with modifications clearly noted)
   
   You may not:
   
   a) Imply endorsement without written permission
   b) Use the marks for modified versions without clear differentiation
   c) Register the marks as your own trademarks

8. NO WARRANTY OF ETHICAL OUTCOMES

   While this software is designed with ethical constraints, the licensors
   make no guarantee that all possible misuse is prevented. Users bear
   responsibility for their use of this software and compliance with
   applicable laws and ethical norms.

PHILOSOPHICAL STATEMENT

This software embodies a fundamental principle: **Ethics by architecture,
not by policy.**

Traditional content moderation asks: "What should we block?"
HarmonyØ4 asks: "What information structure makes harm impossible?"

By generating geometry tokens instead of pixels, this system achieves what
content filters cannot: **provable structural impossibility of deepfakes**.

Three Unbreakable Laws:
  1. No Pixels, Ever → Can't render what doesn't exist
  2. No Identity Parameters → Can't encode what isn't measured
  3. No Randomness → Can't hide what's always auditable

These aren't policies. They're mathematical constraints baked into the
information structure itself.

This is category exit. We don't compete with image generators.
We obsolete the entire threat model.
